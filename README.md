Make sure you've installed:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)
- [mdbook-cmdrun](https://github.com/FauconFan/mdbook-cmdrun)

The custom `theme/highlight.js` is needed because the default mdBook `highlight.js` doesn't include the some languages. To regenerate a custom build of `theme/highlight.js` use `./task.cmake generate`.

To create a new example ("Cool feature" in this example):

1. Add it to `src/SUMMARY.md` like `- [Cool feature](cool-feature/README.md)`.
2. Create a `src/cool-feature/README.md`.
3. Create your example in `src/cool-feature/`. Add a bunch of comments _in the code files_ so that they are visible on the website and when viewing the file in an IDE.
4. `{{#include filename.txt}}` any interesting files in `src/cool-feature/README.md`.
5. Add any shell commands to interact with the example to the `src/cool-feature/README.md`. Make sure to document them.
6. (Optional) Use `<!-- cmdrun cmake ... -->` or similar inside a `` ``` `` code block to run that command and use its output at build time. Remember to add `--fresh` and `--clean-first` to CMake commands so that the output is reproducable. Also add `exec 2>&1 && ...` so that stderr is redirected to stdout (which is what `mdbook-cmdrun` captures).
7. Create a corresponding `.devcontainer/cool-feature/devcontainer.json` that will open the example's folder. Add any necessary dependencies to the dev container.
8. Add an "Open in Codespaces" button to the `src/cool-feature/README.md`.
