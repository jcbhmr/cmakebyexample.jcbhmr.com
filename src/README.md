# CMake by Example

**CMake** is an open source cross-platform meta build system that works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. It is designed to bridge the gap between the platform-specific build tools such as Ninja, GNU Make, BSD Make, Visual Studio, and Xcode. You can read more about CMake on the [official CMake.org website](https://cmake.org/). CMake is best known for its unmatched popularity as the primary C/C++ build tool.

*CMake by Example* is a hands-on introduction to how to use CMake to build C/C++ projects using annotated example projects. Make sure you have [installed the latest version of CMake on your system](https://cmake.org/download/). Check out the first [Hello world](hello-world.md) example to get started.
