## Development

![mdBook](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=mdBook&color=000000&logo=mdBook&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![CMake](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=CMake&color=064F8C&logo=CMake&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

Make sure you've installed [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). You'll also need to install [mdbook-cmdrun](https://github.com/FauconFan/mdbook-cmdrun). Run `mdbook serve` to see the live preview.

The custom `theme/highlight.js` is needed because the default mdBook `highlight.js` doesn't include the `cmake` language. The current custom build includes [all of the mdBook defaults](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/theme/syntax-highlighting.html#supported-languages) plus `cmake`. Generate it using https://highlightjs.org/download and use the `./highlight.min.js` file from the resulting `.zip` download.

To create a new example ("Cool feature" in this example):

1. Add it to `src/SUMMARY.md` like `- [Cool feature](cool-feature/README.md)`.
2. Create a `src/cool-feature/README.md`.
3. Create your example in `src/cool-feature/`. Add a bunch of comments _in the code files_ so that they are visible on the website and when viewing the file in an IDE.
4. `{{#include filename.txt}}` any interesting files in `src/cool-feature/README.md`.
5. Add any shell commands to interact with the example to the `src/cool-feature/README.md`. Make sure to document them.
6. (Optional) Use `<!-- cmdrun cmake ... -->` or similar inside a `` ``` `` code block to run that command and use its output at build time.
7. Create a corresponding `.devcontainer/cool-feature/devcontainer.json` that will open the example's folder. Add any necessary dependencies to the dev container.
8. Add an "Open in Codespaces" button to the `src/cool-feature/README.md`.
